Bash-Snippets
=============

This is a collection of snippets that I have written over the time to automate certain processes. Each of the individual files have comments, if required, to know how to use the script.

The file names are descriptive enough to understand the purpose.

For any issues, you can raise an issue instead of forking the code and solving it yourself, so that the others would be benefitted.
